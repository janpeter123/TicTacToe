# Not cognitive TicTacToe


# About this project
This is a not so intelligent TicTacToe game developed from scratch by me. It is playable in a jupyter notebook or in python console you don't need to download anything, just play.

# How does it work?
I've created a `1d array with 9 spaces` like `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`, those spaces are broken into 3 and displayed to the user. 

Why I did this? Because it was easier ðŸ˜… without any AI knowledge.


Then the bot will pick a random number and see if the place is occupied by the player if not, It'll place the symbol if it is occupied it will again pick another random number and then place it where's available.
The game works better than I expected and it's pretty fun to play with a "dumb" bot
